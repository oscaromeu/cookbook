## Ingredients

- Olive oil, for frying (or use the oil from the tinned sardines if you wish) 
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 
- 75g rough breadcrumbs, made from stale bread 
- 200g dried spaghetti

- 5 oregano sprigs, leaves only, or ½ tsp dried oregano 
- 50g rocket leaves

HOW TO USE UP STALE BREAD While stale bread is perfect for making breadcrumbs, it’s also great for croutons, and for making the classic Tuscan salad Panzanella, based on stale bread, tomatoes, olives, peppers and capers.

## Instructions

1. Heat a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add a glug of oil and, when hot, add half the chopped garlic along with the breadcrumbs. Cook over a medium heat for about 3 minutes until the breadcrumbs are golden and toasted and the garlic tender and lightly browned. Season with salt and pepper and toss together. Drain on kitchen paper. 

2. Cook the pasta in boiling salted water until al dente, according to packet instructions. 

3. Meanwhile, heat a frying pan over a medium heat and add a little oil. Fry the remaining garlic and the chilli for 1–2 minutes. Flake the sardines into small pieces, then toss in the pan with the garlic and chilli. 

4. Drain the cooked pasta and add to the pan with the sardines. Toss to mix well. Add the oregano, taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. 

5. When ready to serve, stir the rocket leaves into the pasta and divide between serving plates. Garnish with the crispy garlic breadcrumbs and serve immediately.
