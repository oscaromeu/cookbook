# Pasta with tomatoes, anchovy and chillies

!!!
Serves 4
!!!

## Ingredients

Pasta and tomato sauce has become a midweek standby in every home. In this classic Italian dish, we are taking that basic sauce to another level by adding a few store cupboard staples – chilli, anchovies, olives and capers. Ready in the time it takes for the pasta to cook, and utterly delicious. 

- 400g dried spaghetti or linguine 
- Olive oil, for frying and drizzling 
- 2–3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 
- 1 dried red chilli, crumbled or chopped into small pieces 
- 1 × 50g tin anchovies in oil, drained and finely chopped 
- 200g pitted black olives, roughly chopped 
- 3 tbsp capers, drained and rinsed 250g cherry tomatoes, halved 
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Basil leaves, to garnish


## Instructions

1. Cook the pasta in boiling salted water until al dente, according to packet instructions. 

2. Meanwhile, heat a wide high-sided frying pan or sauté pan over a medium heat and add a glug of olive oil. Fry the garlic, chilli and anchovies for 1–2 minutes until the garlic is aromatic and the anchovy is beginning to melt into the oil. 

3. Add the olives, capers and tomatoes to the pan and stir over a medium heat for 4–5 minutes until the tomatoes have collapsed and everything is well combined. 

4. Drain the pasta and toss in the pan with the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary (you probably won’t need any salt because of the saltiness of the anchovies, olives and capers). 

5. Serve drizzled with a little olive oil and garnished with basil leaves.

HOW TO COOK PASTA Always use well-salted water to cook pasta because it is impossible to season later. The Italians always use 10g (2 teaspoons) salt for every litre of water. Adding olive oil to the cooking water is helpful, but if you really want to ensure that your pasta doesn’t stick as it cooks, use plenty of water and twist the pan from side to side a few times to get the pasta swirling around just after you’ve put it in.
